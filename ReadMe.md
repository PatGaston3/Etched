## Week 13 Skill Distillery Project 

### Overview 
This project is as much about using JSON and SpringREST as it is handling JSON responses with JavaScript.

'Event Tracker' is a broad term for anything that keeps track of information over time. Examples of these applications are 'Mint' (financial tracking) and 'MyFitnessPal' (diet and exercise tracker).

This Application used to track Pair Programming hours. The application stores information about friends you have paird with as well as aggregated data in the form of <b>Total Pair Programming Hours</b>

### Design
This application was designed to utilize asynchronous requests to Java controller with jQuery's AJAX. I kept the whole application in one DOM (index.html) and manipulated the DOM to change the users view and not switch .html files.

### Challenges

- Transitioning from XHR open requests to AJAX using JQUERY. 

### How to Run
You can run this on my website at http://www.patgaston.com:8080/Etched
